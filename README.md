# MerriamWebsterImporter
This is an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) Addon, which searches for definitions of words or phrases on the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).
It does not use the Merriam-Webster API for reasons of simplification. It loads the html and parses the definitions. 

## Installation Requirements
Anki 2.0.*
